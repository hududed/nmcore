              BLOOM is a revolutionary photosynthesis enhancer that helps your plants thrive, especially in low-light conditions. Think of it as a personal trainer for your plant babies, boosting their photosynthesis game up to 3X!
              Made with cutting-edge nanotechnology, BLOOM mimics chlorophyll, blending naturally into your plants’ chloroplasts to optimize their energy production.

              BLOOM is perfect for giving struggling plants the energy boost they need. Whether your fiddle leaf fig is pouting in a dim corner or your pothos is slacking on the trailing, BLOOM has their back.
              Spray it on the leaves, and watch them perk up like they’ve just had their morning coffee. BLOOM helps them absorb more light, so even those shadowy spots become a green haven.

            <Accordion.Content class="text-base whitespace-pre-line text-left">
              BLOOM is packed with a biocompatible organic compound that supercharges the natural process of photosynthesis. It enhances photon absorption and electron transfer—basically turning your plant into a low-light superstar.
              Picture this: your plants are running on battery mode. BLOOM is the fast charger that keeps them powered up and glowing.

              BLOOM shines (pun intended) in low-light or indoor spaces where sunlight can’t do all the heavy lifting. It’s your secret weapon for winter blues or shaded corners.
              Consistency is key! Use BLOOM regularly to keep your plants energized and growing strong.

            </Accordion.Trigger>
            <Accordion.Content class="text-base whitespace-pre-line text-left">
              For happy, thriving plants, a spritz every 2–3 weeks is just right. For plants that need a little extra TLC, you can use it weekly until they’re back to their best selves.

            <Accordion.Content class="text-base whitespace-pre-line text-left">
              Not at all! BLOOM is designed to be gentle and safe when used as directed. But, as with all things, moderation is key. Don’t overdo it—your plants like balance, too.

              BLOOM’s magic works best when applied in the evening or during low-light hours. This gives your plants time to soak up the good stuff without the risk of sunburn.

              BLOOM is completely safe to handle, but if you prefer to keep your hands clean, a pair of gloves will do the trick.

              Most plants love BLOOM, but if you’re nervous about trying it on your green buddies, do a quick spot test first. Think of it like trying a new skincare product—better safe than sorry!
