            <Accordion.Content class="text-base whitespace-pre-line text-left">
              BLOOM is a groundbreaking photosynthesis enhancer that helps your plants thrive, no matter where they grow. It promotes low-light growth for houseplants and increases yield by up to 30% in outdoor gardens. BLOOM is your secret weapon for greener, healthier plants!

              What do you use BLOOM for?
            </Accordion.Trigger>
            <Accordion.Content class="text-base whitespace-pre-line text-left">
              BLOOM is perfect for: 
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>Indoor plants:</strong> Struggling in dim corners? BLOOM helps houseplants absorb more light and grow lush even in low-light spaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Outdoor gardens:</strong> Need bigger yields? BLOOM optimizes photosynthesis, increasing your harvest without extra effort.</li>
              </ul>

              How does BLOOM work?
            </Accordion.Trigger>
            <Accordion.Content class="text-base whitespace-pre-line text-left">
              BLOOM uses a biocompatible organic compound to supercharge photosynthesis. For houseplants, it enhances light absorption, making dim spaces feel brighter. For gardens, it improves energy efficiency, helping plants channel sunlight into stronger, more productive growth.

              When is BLOOM most effective?
            </Accordion.Trigger>
            <Accordion.Content class="text-base whitespace-pre-line text-left">
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>For <strong>indoor plants</strong>, apply in low-light conditions to maximize effectiveness.</li>
                <li>For <strong>outdoor gardens</strong>, use early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid strong sunlight after spraying.</li>
              </ul>
              Consistency is key! Regular applications keep your plants thriving year-round.

            <Accordion.Content class="text-base whitespace-pre-line text-left">
              Apply every 2–3 weeks for maintenance. For plants needing extra care (like during winter or slow-growth periods), apply weekly until they bounce back.
