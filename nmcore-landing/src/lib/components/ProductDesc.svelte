    <p class="mb-4">Shake vigorously before each use. Spray diluted solution onto plants, ensuring even coverage across all surfacesâ€”including the undersides of the leaves. Avoid overspraying to keep your plants happy and healthy.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">For houseplants, apply in low-light conditions to maximize effectiveness. For outdoor gardens, apply early in the morning or in the evening to protect your plants from excessive sunlight after application.</p>
